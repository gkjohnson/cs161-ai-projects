;;; 3. Missionaries and Cannibals Functions ;;;
; These functions implement a depth-first solver for the missionary-cannibal
; problem. In this problem, three missionaries and three cannibals are trying to
; go from the east side of a river to the west side. They have a single boat
; that can carry two people at a time from one side of the river to the
; other. There must be at least one person in the boat to cross the river. There
; can never be more cannibals on one side of the river than missionaries. If
; there are, the cannibals eat the missionaries.

; In this implementation, a state is represented by a single list
; (missionaries cannibals side). side represents which side the boat is
; currently on, and is T if it is on the east side and NIL if on the west
; side. missionaries and cannibals represent the number of missionaries and
; cannibals on the same side as the boat. Thus, the initial state for this
; problem is (3 3 T) (three missionaries, three cannibals, and the boat are all
; on the east side of the river) and the goal state is (3 3 NIL).

; The main entry point for this solver is the function MC-DFS, which is called
; with the initial state to search from and the path to this state. It returns
; the complete path from the initial state to the goal state: this path is a
; list of intermediate problem states. The first element of the path is the
; initial state and the last element is the goal state. Each intermediate state
; is the state that results from applying the appropriate operator to the
; preceding state. If there is no solution, MC-DFS returns NIL.

; To call MC-DFS to solve the original problem, one would call (MC-DFS '(3 3 T)
; NIL) -- however, it would be possible to call MC-DFS with a different initial
; state or with an initial path.

; Examples of calls to some of the helper functions can be found after the code.

; FINAL-STATE takes a single argument s, the current state, and returns T if it
; is the goal state (3 3 NIL) and NIL otherwise.
(defun final-state (s)
	(cond
		;if s equals the final state, return true
		((equal s '(3 3 NIL)) T)
		(T nil)
	)
 )

; NEXT-STATE returns the state that results from applying an operator to the
; current state. It takes three arguments: the current state (s), a number of
; missionaries to move (m), and a number of cannibals to move (c). It returns a
; list containing the state that results from moving that number of missionaries
; and cannibals from the current side of the river to the other side of the
; river. If applying this operator results in an invalid state (because there
; are more cannibals than missionaries on either side of the river, or because
; it would move more missionaries or cannibals than are on this side of the
; river) it returns NIL.
;
; NOTE that next-state returns a list containing the successor state (which is
; itself a list); the return should look something like ((1 1 T)).

; Takes current state s, and missionaries 'm' and cannibals 'c' to move
; returns a list of the one resulting state after moving the missionaries/cannibals
; returns nil if it results in an invalid state
