 a.
    Method: Fixed "LightSensor" to be On and "SoundSensor" to be off in order to get 
	the most likely instantiations
	
    ExpectingGuests: No
    OutdoorLight: On
    FamilyHome: No
    DogOutside: Yes
    DogBowelTrouble: Yes
    HearableBarking: No
    DogBarking: No
    LightSensorHealth: OK
    SoundSensorHealth: OK
    Battery: OK
 b.
    Method: Fixed "FamilyIsHome" to be Yes and "ExpectingGuests" to be No in order to get
	the most likely instantiations
	
    OutdoorLight: Off
    DogOutside: Yes
    DogBowelTrouble: Yes
    HearableBarking: No
    DogBarking: Yes
    LightSensor: Off
    SoundSensor: Off
	LightSensorHealth: OK
	SoundSensorHealth: OK
	Battery: OK
 c.
    Two variables minimum are needed
	For example, both "Battery" and "FamilyIsHome" could be fixed in order to make the sensors
	independent because both are divergent "valves" so "closing" them by fixing their value
	causes both sensors to be d-separated
