Binary Variable A
	Pr(A)+Pr(!A)=1
	Pr(true)=1
	Pr(A or B) = Pr(A)+Pr(B)-P(A,B) (A and B)
	
If A or B are mutually exclusive
	P(A,B)=0
	P(A or B)=P(A)+P(B)
	
	
	if one is true, then the other must be false
	
Conditional Probability
	P(A|B)= P(A,B)
			------
			P(B)
			
	if B is a subset of A, then the probability of A given B is 1 (A is true in all worlds that B is true because its a subset)

Bayes' Rule
	P(A|B) = P(B|A) P(A)
			 -----------
			 P(B)
			 
			 
	Derivation:
		P(A,B)=P(B,A)
		P(A|B)*P(B)=P(B|A)*P(A)
		P(A|B) = P(B|A) P(A)
				-----------
				P(B)
		
		
		P(B|A)=P(B,A)      ->     P(B|A)*P(A)=P(B,A)
			   ------
			   P(A)
			   
Independence
	P(A)=P(A|B)
	P(B)=P(B|A)
	
	
Conditional Independence
	P(A|B)=P(A|B,C)

	Shoe size is dependent on age
	Shoe size is conditionally independent of age given height

	I(X,Z,Y)=every subset of X is independent of every subset of Y, given Z
	
Chain Rule
	P(A,B,C,D)=P(A|B,C,D)*P(B|C,D)*P(C|D)*P(D)=P(A,B,C,D)/P(B,C,D) * P(B,C,D)/P(C,D) * P(C,D)/P(D) * P(D)

	With larger number of variables, becomes way too unwieldly
	
Bayesian Networks
	- What is it? DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph
	- Nodes are variables/events
	- Edges are direct causal effects
	- A->B
	
	
	
	Age->Height->ShoeSize (age causes height, height causes shoe size)

	Parents(N)=immediate parents of the node N
	Descendants(N)=*all* children under the node (even children of children)
	Non-Descendants(N)=all nodes but N, Descendents(N), and Parents(N)
	
	
D-Separation
	- Tells about conditional independence
	Valves:
		- sequential ->O->
		- convergent ->O<-
		- divergent  <-O->
