Propositional Logic
	- syntax
	- semantics
	
Inference
	1 enumerating models
	2 inference
	3 CSP
	
logic:
delta - if A and (AvB)=>C is true
alpha is c

A B C	|	AvB	|	(AvB)=>C	| delta
---------------------------------------
1 1 1	|	1	|		1		|	1
1 1 0	|	1	|		0		|	0
1 0 1	|	1	|		1		|	1
1 0 0	|	1	|		0		|	0
0 1 1	|	1	|		1		|	0
0 1 0	|	1	|		0		|	0
0 0 1	|	0	|		1		|	0
0 0 0	|	0	|		1		|	0

delta implies alpha uf the models of delta are included by alpha

models of delta are included by models of alpha
therefore, delta implies alpha

models of delta intersecting models of NOT alpha = empty set
same as models of delta AND NOT alpha = empty set -> unsatisfiable

Showing that alpha=>beta is the same as NOT alpha OR Beta

alpha	|	beta	|	alpha=>beta	|	NOT alpha OR beta
---------------------------------------------------------
	1	|		1	|		1		|		1
	1	|		0	|		0		|		0
	0	|		1	|		1		|		1
	0	|		0	|		1		|		1
	
	
	
	
delta:
	alpha1
	alpha2
	alpha3
	...
	alphan
	
	
alpha, alpha=>beta	(inferences conditions/rules)
------------------		completeness
	   beta
	   
	   
	   
		|
delta	|----	alpha
		|	R
alpha is derivable from delta using inferences rules R


completeness: if delta implies alpha then alpha is derivable from delta using R

soundness: if alpha is derived by delta using rules R, then delta implies alpha

We want something that is both sound and complete

R is knowledge base?



  Alpha,Beta
--------------      AND introduction         Top derives bottom
alpha AND beta

     Alpha
--------------      OR introduction
alpha OR beta


Inference Rule: Resolution
	
	alphaORbeta, NOTalphaORbeta
	---------------------------
	            beta
		
	- if knowledge base is in CNF then resolution is "refutation complete"
