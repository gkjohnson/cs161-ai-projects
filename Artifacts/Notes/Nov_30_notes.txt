output unit                     o    ai
                wji

hidden unit      o           o          o          o     aj
       wkj

input units  s       s   s      s    s       s  s        s   ak

a are the nodes
w are the connectors





Learning:
1. Bayesian Networks  - Non supervised
2. Decision Trees     \
3. Neural Networks    - Supervised

inputs go into the activation function, summing the inputs and calculating:
1. inj = sum from j of ajwji
2. aj=g(inj)


Activation Functions (g)
a. Step Function
	- if the value is less than t, it is zero, otherwise it's 1
	
b. sign Function
	- if the input is less than 0, then it is -1, otherwise its +1 for >0
	
c. Signoid Function or (Sigmoid?)
	- g(x)=1/(1+e^(-x))

Inverter:
 I-> g(x) t=-/5 ->              I | O
  w=-1                          1 | 0
								0 | 1
